This work is on process research to predict compond protein interactions, and is based on on the script as  mentioned below: 

# The original content: Compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction using a GNN for compounds and a CNN for proteins

This code is an implementation of our paper
"[Compound-protein Interaction Prediction with End-to-end Learning of Neural Networks for Graphs and Sequences (Bioinformatics, 2018)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty535/5050020?redirectedFrom=PDF)" in PyTorch.
In this repository, we provide two CPI datasets: human and *C. elegans* created by
"[Improving compoundâ€“protein interaction prediction by building up highly credible negative samples (Bioinformatics, 2015).](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/12/i221/216307)"
Note that the ratio of positive and negative samples is 1:1.
